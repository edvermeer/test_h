So is this thing, kind of a trope in movies and TV shows when one of the opposing parties in the story under some dramatic situation is waiting for some satellite to come online  to perform some task.

Who the fuck shoots a satellite on orbit for a fuck load of money to keep it orbiting idly, than waits for the thing to slowly boot it up to solve an immediate and present catastrophe?

And yep, it's my birthday. how accidental and trivial at the same time.
